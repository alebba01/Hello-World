These are the only files that should be run for IMU communications.

The measurement acquisition is done with the baud rate set at 921k6,
but the standard baud rate is 115k2. Therefore, there the two files
to change the baud rate between the two.

USB1 files are because speedgoat serial cable tends to initialize first,
so they switch which device is on USB0 (originally the IMU, now the SG)
and USB1. Otherwise, they are the same.
